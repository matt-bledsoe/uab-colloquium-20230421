-   Quantification of risk $\Rightarrow$ models
-   Increasing amounts of data and computing resources available $\Rightarrow$ bigger models
-   (De-)Regulation $\Rightarrow$ more models

- It's always liquidity!!!
- The inability, actual or _perceived_, of a financial institution to meet its obligations
- Can be very fast-paced as time horizons are short (intraday, daily, weekly)
- Very difficult to model with "traditional" techniques

- At banks since the Volcker Rule
  + Trading is done on behalf of clients (in a separate subsidiary) or is "plain vanilla"
  + Mainly interested in the effect of movements of interest rates on the expected income/expense or value of interest-bearing contracts (loans, deposits, bonds, interest rate swaps)
